    note: |
        [Mathias Ertl](https://github.com/mathiasertl) submitted
        [Python 3 patches](https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues/1378)
        to the Fabric maintainer.  These patches stopped compatibility with
        Python 2.5 and earlier, so the Fabric maintainer did not accept them.
        Mathias forked the code, released the code to pypi.
        It can be installed with `pip install Fabric3`.
