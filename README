A database of packages that need porting to Python 3, and tools to manage it.


# Installation

This software is still in the initial phases of development, so it is not
yet packaged. Install it directly from Git working directory:

    $ python3 -m pip install --user -e.


# Usage

First, you will need to load a database.

    $ python3 -m portingdb --datadir data/ load

This will create a `portingdb.sqlite` file in the current directory.
Currently, the database needs to be deleted and re-reloaded every time the
data changes.

To check the database, do:

    $ python3 -m portingdb status

To start a HTML report server, start:

    $ python3 -m portingdb serve
